"""
You are trying to create a better guinea pig food blend. For a dayâ€™s worth of food, you 
would like it to contain a minimum of 25 grams (g) of fat, 32 grams of carbohydrates, and 
5 grams of protein. But the guinea pig can only have 4 oz of food a day. 

You have two existing foods: Food A and Food B, and you want to blend them to create 
your balanced diet. Food A contains 6g of fat, 13g of carbohydrates, and 3g of protein per 
ounce, and costs $0.40 per ounce. Food B contains 11g of fat, 14g of carbohydrates, and 
2g of protein per ounce, at a cost of $0.30 per ounce.

How many ounces of each food should you mix each day, while minimizing cost? Complete
the code below by replacing the ?'s.
